# Refloid

This repository contains a GPU-based raytracer based on the NVIDIA optics framework (NVIDIA-Optix-6.0). It was developed to simulate geometrical optical measurement techniques with the focus on predicting interfering reflections during measurements.

Through object-oriented programming, great care has been taken to ensure that the raytracer is kept general and can therefore be expanded for any application in geometrical-optical metrology.

## Dependencies

    - Optix 6.0
    - Qt5 (From apt tree)
